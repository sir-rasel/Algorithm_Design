# Algorithm_Design #
## Description ##
This is a data structure and algorithm made by myself. Basically all codes are design as they can be used in competitive programming.
But feel free for using this library.
    -> Implementation of different essential algorithm and their supporting non build-in data structure.
    -> Generally there stay some essential and well know algorithm whose we use our general 'software engineering'.
    -> Those algorithm are mostly suitable for "Competative programming".
    -> This can be used as a supporting role of university "Algorithm Design" course.

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
Feel free for any kind of bug fixing and changes. Also feel free for using this libraries code for many purpose.
